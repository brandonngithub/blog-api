# blog-api

This repository is for the blog's backend API.

(1/3) of the Blog project:

1. [Repo for the API](https://github.com/brandonngithub/blog-api)
2. [Repo for the read and comment frontend](https://github.com/brandonngithub/blog-read-comment)
3. [Repo for the write, edit, and publish frontend](https://github.com/brandonngithub/blog-write-edit-publish)

I decided to split this project into different repositories to exercise setting up the API and then accessing it from the outside.
